*** Course Description

 This course is designed to provide undergraduate (and graduate)
 students an in-depth introduction to the archaeology of the Hawaiian
 Islands. Topics that we will consider include (but not be limited to)
 archaeology's contribution to traditional and post-Contact history,
 the geographical and historical origins of the Polynesian discoverers,
 the timing of island colonization and settlement, the development and
 innovation of food production and craft economies, the emergence of
 socio-political hierarchies, and some consequences of contact and
 colonialism.  We will also consider the relevance of archaeology to
 contemporary society.

 Students are expected to be interested in old Hawai`i and curious
 about how archaeology might contribute to Hawaiian history.  There
 will be a research paper (10 pages plus bibliography) and other
 shorter writing assignments. This course is designed for
 upper-division undergraduates and graduate students. We welcome all
 students with interests in old Hawai`i. A background in archaeology is
 helpful but not a prerequisite.

*** Student Learning Outcomes
  - Students can evaluate the validity and limitations of
    archaeological theories and research claims.
  - Students understand the tempo of change in old Hawai`i.
  - Students are familiar with the materials and methods of Hawaiian
    archaeology.

*** Textbook

 The required textbook for this semester is /Hawaii's Past in a World
 of Pacific Islands/, by J. M. Bayman and T. S. Dye (2013), SAA Press,
 Washington.

 We will read and discuss the book critically, focusing primarily on
 the archaeological materials and secondarily on the relationship of
 archaeological evidence to other kinds of evidence.

*** Mid-Term Examination
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: mid-term-examination
    :END:
 The mid-term examination includes three essay questions, chosen from a list of
 discussion questions available on Laulima. Note that students have the
 opportunity to discuss these discussioin questions during class meetings leading up
 to the mid-term examination (but not during the examination), although students will
 not know ahead of time which discussion questions will appear on the mid-term
 examination.

*** Term Paper

    :CUSTOM_ID: term-paper
    :END:

 A passing grade in this course requires the student to undertake and complete a
 term-long writing project. The term paper will summarize and critically review
 an archaeological excavation report (or a particular topic taken from the report) and
 supplementary material as appropriate.

 Students may select an excavation report from the following list. These reports
 and supplementary materials are either available online or held on course
 reserve at Hamilton Library. Alternatively, students with particular interests
 may write a term paper on another excavation report; in this case, please
 consult with =tdye@hawaii.edu= to negotiate a mutually agreeable excavation
 report.

   - Bellows Dune Site, O`ahu :: One of the first excavations of a stratified
        beach site in Hawai`i. The site continues to play an important role in
        archaeological narratives, but its interpretation has changed over time.
        In particular, the dating of the site has been revised.
   - Site 4727, Hawai`i :: A University of Hawai`i field school from 1968 to 1970
        documented the pattern of settlement in the agricultural fields of upland
        Lapakahi /ahupua`a/ on the leeward side of Kohala district. Site 4727 is
        a dwelling surrounded by sweet potato gardens that yielded an
        unexpectedly complex habitation history.
 #  Rosendahl Hawaiian Archaeology 3, Arlas in the Tuggle volume.
   - Ordy Pond, O`ahu :: A paleoenvironmental coring project at Ordy Pond in the
        `Ewa district yielded crucial evidence for when Polynesians discovered
        the islands and the environmental effects that followed discovery.
  #      Athens article, Athens rat paper.
   - Wai`ahukini Cave, Hawai`i :: Excavation of a fisherman's shelter
        in the 1960's yielded a large assemblage of fishing gear. One of the few excavations of a
        fisherman's cave before looters destroyed deposits in other coastal caves
        searching for fishhooks to sell. The dating of the site has been revised.
  #      Sinoto DRS, Mulrooney et al., fishhook web site.
   - Kal\amacron{}huipua`a Site E1-355, Hawai`i :: A small cave located immediately inland of a
        fishpond was thoroughly excavated in the mid 1970's.  The site yielded a
        large amount of cultural material, primarily food remains, domestic
        tools, and fishing gear.
   - Fort DeRussy, O`ahu :: Archaeology beneath the surface of this military
        installation in  Waik\imacron{}k\imacron{} was undertaken using a backhoe guided by
        nineteenth century maps.   The backhoe unearthed a buried fishpond and
        the archaeologist was able to date construction of an /`auwai/ that
        brought fresh water to the pond.
 #       Davis IARII report.
   - K\amacron{}ne`aki Heiau, O`ahu :: A classic excavation designed to investigate the
        history of construction and guide renovation of a temple in Makaha Valley.
   - H\amacron{}lawa Pondfield, Hawai`i :: An unexpectedly deep excavation in a narrow
        valley on the windward coast of Hawai`i Island revealed a long history of
        taro pondfield construction and renovation.
 # McCoy et al.
   - Kahikinui, Maui :: This innovative excavation project took a regional
        perspective and focused on the stratigraphic position of architectural
        features.
 # Dixon Kahikinui from SHPD
   - Kona Shelter Cave, Hawai`i :: A cave excavation at the /mauka/ edge of Kailua
        town yielded abundant material that the archaeologist reconstitutes as
        reflecting subsistence practices and conflict.
   - Nualolo Kai, Kaua`i :: Re-excavation of a site with spectacular preservation
        of normally perishable materials revealed deep stratification. Bishop
        Museum excavations here in the 1950's were extensive, but haven't been
        published.
 #  Hunt et al.
   - H\amacron{}lawa Dune Site, Moloka`i :: Another excavation of a stratified beach site
        from the 1960's that has a prominent place in archaeological narratives.
        The dating of the site has been revised.
 # Kirch, Kirch and McCoy.
   - K\amacron{}newai, O`ahu :: Backhoe excavations prior to construction of the Hawaiian
                       Studies building here on campus yielded evidence of change
                       over time in an irrigation system that fed pondfields in
                       one of the most productive agricultural systems on O`ahu.
   - M\amacron{}h\amacron{}`ulep\umacron{}, Kaua`i :: Paleoenvironmental excavations in waterlogged sediments
        at a large cave yielded a rich record of changes over time in the flora
        and fauna of Kaua`i.
 # Burney.
   - Anahulu Valley, O`ahu :: The Anahulu Valley project focused on excavation of
        M\amacron{}hele era sites that are known from land records. The project teamed
        archaeologists under the direction of Pat Kirch with the historical
        anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, who produced an historical ethnography
        of the valley. Student papers will focus on one of the following sites:
     - Site D6-25 :: The house site of Kaneiaulu.
     - Site D6-34 :: The house site of Kainiki.
     - Site D6-38 :: The house site of Kalua.
   - Wailau Valley, Moloka`i :: An innovative regional excavation project carried
        out in the pondfields of a large, undeveloped valley for a dissertation
        here in the Anthropology Department.

 Summarize in your own words what the author(s) of the report claimed the
 excavation had revealed about old Hawai`i.  Take care to state the claims as
 precisely as you can.  The critical part of your paper, which you will write
 later, will compare the evidence from the excavation with these claims.  Do your
 best to state the claims at face value and try not to read into them your own
 opinions and experiences.

    :END:

 Every archaeologist comes to an excavation with background knowledge---beliefs
 about the past---that are used to *guide inquiry* and to *frame hypotheses* the
 excavation might be expected to test. What background knowledge did the
 author(s) of the report you are reviewing bring to their work? Draw as much of
 this as possible from the report itself, however, be aware that it is rare to
 find a full discussion of background information in an excavation report. Is
 background information provided for each of the claims made in the
 reconstitution? If not, what is missing?

 Attempt to fill in any missing background information based on your readings
 (including the textbook), the lectures, class discussions, and specific
 questions you have for the instructor. What beliefs about old Hawai`i were
 commonly held by archaeologists when the fieldwork for your excavation report
 was carried out?

 Identify the specific topic that will be the focus of your term paper.  You can
 choose to review the complete excavation report, or you can choose to focus on
 some part of the report that catches your interest.  Describe why you have made
 this choice and suggest why the reader might find your topic interesting.

 Referring to your [[#abstract-and-bibliography][specific topic]], describe how the excavation was structured to
 record space and time. Are space and time treated in a way that will make it
 possible to test hypotheses and fields of inquiry identified in [[#refine-proposal][acquisition]]?
 Were they treated in a way that will support the [[#form-questions][reconstitution claims]]? How were
 the artifacts of interest classified?  Referring again to [[#refine-proposal][acquisition]] and
 [[*Reconstitution][reconstitution]], are the classifications used in the report reasonable and useful?

 Write a 75 word abstract summarizing the paper you hope to write.
 Attach an outline with section headings and a draft of your bibliography. This
 bibliography should identify a list of five or more sources that include books,
 journals, and on-line resources. You can use Google and Wikipedia as much or
 little as you like, but your bibliography /must/ include some books and/or
 journal articles.

 Here your goal is to produce a coherent whole. Use material from previous
 writing assignments as much as possible. The draft can be rough but it must be
 complete, with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. It also needs in-text

 Your research presentation should /not/ be a simple "replay" of your
 topic but should be re-designed so that you
  - spend some time talking spontaneously
  - employ more than one medium (such as slides)
  - engage your classmates in discussion

 A successful presentation will focus on one part of the research, without trying
 to cover all of the research in your paper. You will have about 15--20 minutes
 to make your presentation; this will include time devoted to questions and
 answers.

 Your presentation will be graded separately from your paper.

 # Textbook, Chapter 5.
  - On page 67 the textbook contrasts "the more or less synchronic
    perspective on Hawaiian craft economies in the post-contact period"
    offered by study of museum ethnographic collections with "the
    long-term historical development of Hawaiian technologies and craft
    economies" offered by archaeological study.  What are some things
    that can be learned by archaeological study that can't be learned
    from museum collections?
  - Over the years there have been suggestions that fishhooks and adzes
    changed over time, so that there are early forms and late forms of
    both artifacts.  Why aren't these artifacts used to date sites in
    Hawai`i?
  - Describe the difference between "attached specialists" and
    "independent specialists."  Why has this distinction so far proved
    impossible to make with archaeological materials from Hawai`i?

    kinds of remains were recovered?
  - What is an otolith?  How did the identification of /`\omacron{}`io/ otoliths
    change the picture of traditional Hawaiian fishing at Waim\amacron{}nalo?
  - Compare the photograph of the stratigraphic profile (slide 13) with
    the stratigraphic profile drawn by Kim Kalama (slide 15).  What
    kinds of thing are easier to see in the drawing?  Why?
  - What kinds of activities are represented in the artifact
    collection?  How would you characterize traditional Hawaiian
    settlement at the site?

 # Texbook Chapter 6, PWW glass lecture

  - Describe the distribution of Pu`uwa`awa`a volcanic glass away from
    its source in North Kona.  How does this distribution indicate the
    value of the glass?
  - Describe the differences between "cost surface overland", "`as the
    crow flies' overland", and "canoe from depot" models of volcanic
    glass distribution.  Is it useful to have these different models?
    Why or why not?
  - At the time of European contact, Hawaiian /ali`i/ were among the
    most powerful people in all of Polynesia. Many archaeologists
    believe that warfare was essential for /ali`i/ to establish power.
    Where does the evidence to support the importance of warfare in old
    Hawai`i come from?  Does the archaeological record show that
    Hawaiian society was war-like?  Why or why not?
  - What is the "correlate method" for identifying states with
    archaeological materials?  Accepting that contact-era Hawaiian
    society was a state, does the "correlate method" work?  Why or why
    not?

 # Hawaiian Ko`i
  - Describe the parts of a traditional Hawaiian adze blade.  Which
    features do Hawaiian archaeologists use to classify the adze
    blades? Do these features relate to the form of the tool, its
    function, or both?  How so?
  - Describe the two reduction sequences identified for Hawaiian
    adzes.  How do these sequences relate to the form of the finished
    tool?

    # Chapter 7, Rain-fed agriculture

  - Describe the post-contact history of the Hawaiian adze.  What
    social and economic factors contributed to the persistence of stone
    adze use in the post-contact period?
  - Describe the changes in Hawaiian household settlement pattern when
    traditional building materials were abandoned and imported
    materials took their place.  How were these settlement pattern changes
    related to social changes?
  - What are the cross-cultural attributes of wealth-assets?  How are
    wealth-assets distinguished from other valuables?
  - Describe the development of the leeward Kohala field system.  Would
    a map of the field system that charts development by successive
    generations of Hawaiian farmers be useful?  Why or why not?

  - There is no doubt that canoes were valuable in old Hawai`i.  Were
    they also wealth-assets?  Why or why not?
  - Describe the scale of abrader quarrying at Kahuku.  Does it
    surprise you?  Why or why not?  What does the scale of abrader
    quarrying indicate about old Hawai`i?

  - Describe the next generation of Hawaiian archaeologists and compare
    it to the current generation.  What are the similarities and
    differences?  What changes to archaeological practice should the
    new generation of archaeologists strive to establish?
  - Does archaeology have a future in Hawai`i?  Is archaeology useful
    in the process of decolonization, or does it work to maintain a
    colonized mindset?

Make the non-breaking space with alt-shift

You may add _ to "pre" part of `org-emphasis-regexp-components' in

So far, I've added " ", "–" which are the characters for non-breaking
space and single space.

*** Cross references Leech-Pepin
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID: Test
   :END:

This code inserts cross references into an Org mode document.  It
looks back at the word before point and distinguishes figures, tables,
listings, chapters, and sections.  Then, using helm's hook into
completing-read, it displays a list of the relevant candidates.  The
function depends on the convention of starting figure labels with
"fig:" and table labels with "tab:".  These prefixes are the default
with AucTeX, and I'm accustomed to using them.

Jonathan Leech-Pepin helped make the code work properly.

*** Koma Article
The following two source code blocks set up a LaTeX class named
=koma-article= that is referenced near the top of the file. The
=koma-article= class is based on the [[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script][Koma script]] article class
=scrartcl=, which uses a sans-serif font for headings and a serif font
for body text.

The =koma-article= class uses fonts from the [[http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/][TeX Gyre collection of
fonts]]. As explained in [[http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/tb87hagen-gyre.pdf][The New Font Project: TeX Gyre]], a goal of the
project was to produce good quality fonts with diacritical characters
sufficient to cover all European languages as well as Vietnamese and
Navajo.

The source code block named [[koma-article-times][koma-article-times]] is based on the Times
Roman font. The serif Termes font is a replacement for Times Roman,
the sans-serif Heros font is a replacement for Helvetica, and the
typewriter Cursor font is a replacement for Courier. The source code
block named [[koma-article-palatino][koma-article-palatino]] is based on the beautiful Palatino
font designed by Hermann Zapf. The Pagella font is the TeX Gyre
replacement for Palatino. Typographers often recommend that
linespacing be increased slightly with Palatino, and this has been
achieved with the addition of the =linespacing= command.  The sans
serif font is the demibold weight of Source Sans Pro, which shares
many structural characteristics with Palatino.  I think it yields a
beautiful document.

The Tex Gyre fonts benefit from the [[http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/microtype][microtype package]], which provides
"subliminal refinements towards typographical perfection," including
"character protrusion and font expansion, furthermore the adjustment
of inter-word spacing and additional kerning, as well as hyphenatable
letter spacing (tracking) and the possibility to disable all or
selected ligatures."

In addition, the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/paralist/][paralist package]] is used for its compact versions of
the LaTeX list environments.

Finally, the =newcommand= is provided merely as an illustration of one
way to move LaTeX declarations out of the Org file header. This one is
useful in my work as an archaeologist and over the years it has crept
into my BibTeX database. It shouldn't interfere with your work, but
you might want to remove it or replace it with LaTeX commands that you
do frequently use.
