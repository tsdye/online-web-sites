<h2 id="choose-topic">Choose excavation report</h2>

reasons for choosing it and describe what you hope to learn from it.</p>

<dd>An innovative regional excavation project carried

here in the Anthropology Department.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="form-questions">Reconstitution</h2>

<p>Summarize in your own words what the author(s) of the report claimed the
excavation had revealed about old Hawai`i.  Take care to state the claims as
precisely as you can.  The critical part of your paper, which you will write
later, will compare the evidence from the excavation with these claims.  Do your
best to state the claims at face value and try not to read into them your own
opinions and experiences.</p>

<h2 id="refine-proposal">Acquisition 1</h2>

<p>Every archaeologist comes to an excavation with background knowledge&mdash;beliefs
about the past&mdash;that are used to <strong>guide inquiry</strong> and to <strong>frame hypotheses</strong> the
excavation might be expected to test. What background knowledge did the
author(s) of the report you are reviewing bring to their work? Draw as much of
this as possible from the report itself, however, be aware that it is rare to
find a full discussion of background information in an excavation report. Is
background information provided for each of the claims made in the
reconstitution? If not, what is missing?</p>

<h2 id="pitch-research">Acquisition 2</h2>

<p>Attempt to fill in any missing background information based on your readings
(including the textbook), the lectures, class discussions, and specific
questions you have for the instructor. What beliefs about old Hawai`i were
commonly held by archaeologists when the fieldwork for your excavation report
was carried out?</p>

<h2 id="abstract-and-bibliography">Specific Topic</h2>

<p>Identify the specific topic that will be the focus of your term paper.  You can
choose to review the complete excavation report, or you can choose to focus on
some part of the report that catches your interest.  Describe why you have made
this choice and suggest why the reader might find your topic interesting.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-and-outline">Structuration</h2>

<p>Referring to your <a href="#abstract-and-bibliography">specific topic</a>, describe how the excavation was structured to
record space and time. Are space and time treated in a way that will make it
possible to test hypotheses and fields of inquiry identified in <a href="#refine-proposal">acquisition</a>?
Were they treated in a way that will support the <a href="#form-questions">reconstitution claims</a>? How were
the artifacts of interest classified?  Referring again to <a href="#refine-proposal">acquisition</a> and
<a href="#form-questions">reconstitution</a>, are the classifications used in the report reasonable and useful?</p>

<h2 id="two-body-paragraphs">Abstract, Outline, and Bibliography</h2>

<p>Write a 75 word abstract summarizing the paper you hope to write.
Attach an outline with section headings and a draft of your bibliography. This
bibliography should identify a list of five or more sources that include books,
journals, and on-line resources. You can use Google and Wikipedia as much or
little as you like, but your bibliography <em>must</em> include some books and/or
journal articles.</p>

<h2 id="first-draft">First draft</h2>

<p>Here your goal is to produce a coherent whole. Use material from previous
writing assignments as much as possible. The draft can be rough but it must be
complete, with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. It also needs in-text
citations and a bibliography of references cited! You will receive feedback on
your draft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write your first draft with your heart. Re-write with your head.&rdquo;
~ from the movie <em>Finding Forrester</em></p>

<h2 id="final-term-paper">Final term paper</h2>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a very good writer, but I&rsquo;m an excellent rewriter.&rdquo; ~ James Michener</p>
