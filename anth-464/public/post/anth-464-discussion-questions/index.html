<p>These discussion questions help guide the conversation.  They are meant to
augment the questions you bring to class.  Also, note that Discussion Questions
1&ndash;6 include the three questions that will appear on the mid-term examination.</p>

<h2 id="dq1">Discussion Questions 1</h2>

<ul>
<li>How has the institutional framework of Hawaiian archaeology changed
over time?</li>
<li>What was the innovation introduced by the settlement pattern
approach?</li>
<li>What research questions occupy Hawaiian archaeologists today?</li>
<li>How is archaeology different from history?</li>
<li>How is historicism different from social science?</li>
<li>Why study archaeology?</li>
<li>Is the temple on L&amp;#0257na`i Island a site?  Why, or why not?</li>
<li>What is the necessary condition of inquiry?  Is scientific inquiry
fundamentally different from other forms of inquiry?  Why or why
not?</li>
<li>List the three logical steps of and describe
them in your own terms.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dq2">Discussion Questions 2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Describe the geological stages of islands in the Hawaiian Chain,
starting at Hawai`i Island in the southeast and ending at H&amp;#0333lanik&amp;#0363
in the northwest.  What is responsible for the differences?</li>
<li>From the point of view of Polynesian sailors, describe the factors
that make the Hawaiian chain an isolated landmass.</li>
<li>Imagine yourself on the voyage with the Polynesian discoverers of
Hawai`i.  What strange and unusual plants and animals might you
have seen when you first stepped ashore?</li>
<li>Briefly describe one of the misunderstandings between <em>kanaka
maoli</em> and Cook&rsquo;s crew, focusing on the different ideas at its
heart.  Are your ideas today closer to Cook&rsquo;s crew&rsquo;s ideas, or to
the ideas held by <em>kanaka maoli</em> in 1778&ndash;1779?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dq3">Discussion Questions 3</h2>

<ul>
<li>Compare and contrast the three different ways archaeologists have
tried to estimate the date when Polynesians discovered Hawai`i.
What is the best estimate of the discovery date?</li>
<li>Hawaiian archaeologists routinely confuse <em>sites</em> and <em>surface</em>
<em>architectural features</em>.  Is this a problem?  Why or why not?</li>
<li>How does Hommon&rsquo;s model for the development of traditional Hawaiian
settlement relate to the division of lands into <em>moku</em> and <em>ahupua`a</em>?</li>
<li>From the lecture, summarize the archaeological sequence of Hawai`i
in terms of Discovery, Colonization, Settlement, and Innovation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dq4">Discussion Questions 4</h2>

<ul>
<li>Describe the differences between Tongan and Hawaiian kinship
terms.  How do the differences in terms reflect differences in
social organization?</li>
<li>What is the <em>fahu</em> relationship in Tonga?  How was it involved in
the relationship of the sacred Tu`i Tonga to the secular Tu`i
Kanokupolu?</li>
<li>Describe the movement of people and things through the Tongan
empire.  How did the movement of people and things support the high
status of the Tu`i Tonga?</li>
<li>Traditional Hawaiian political power is sometimes characterized as
territorial in comparison to Tonga.  Describe the territorial
organization of Hawaiian kingship.  Suggest some ideas why Hawaiian
kings were different from kings in Tonga.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dq5">Discussion Questions 5</h2>

<ul>
<li>What influence did the introduction of the Polynesian rat have on
Hawaiian natural history?  Were these changes good or bad for the
Polynesian colonists?  Why?</li>
<li>Describe the process by which Polynesians transformed the Hawaiian
landscape, changing it from its natural state to one more like the
homeland islands.</li>
<li>How does traditional Hawaiian rain-fed agriculture differ from
traditional irrigated agriculture?  How are the two types of
agriculture distributed across the islands?</li>
<li>Describe the leeward Kohala field system.  How and when did it
develop?</li>
<li>Describe the distribution of faunal remains in archaeological sites
on the leeward side of Hawai`i Island.  What does this pattern
indicate about traditional Hawaiian behavior?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dq6">Discussion Questions 6</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why is the base of surface architecture important to an
archaeologist?</li>
<li>How old are the oldest well-dated Hawaiian habitation structures?
How are their construction dates related to the traditional
Hawaiian cultural sequence?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dq7">Discussion Questions 7</h2>

<ul>
<li>On page 67 the textbook contrasts &ldquo;the more or less synchronic
perspective on Hawaiian craft economies in the post-contact period&rdquo;
offered by study of museum ethnographic collections with &ldquo;the
long-term historical development of Hawaiian technologies and craft
economies&rdquo; offered by archaeological study.  What are some things
that can be learned by archaeological study that can&rsquo;t be learned
from museum collections?</li>
<li>Over the years there have been suggestions that fishhooks and adzes
changed over time, so that there are early forms and late forms of
both artifacts.  Why aren&rsquo;t these artifacts used to date sites in
Hawai`i?</li>
<li>Describe the difference between &ldquo;attached specialists&rdquo; and
&ldquo;independent specialists.&rdquo;  Why has this distinction so far proved
impossible to make with archaeological materials from Hawai`i?
(Hint: see .)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dq8">Discussion Questions 8</h2>

<ul>
<li>How was the topography of the Waim&amp;#0257nalo Plain (slide 5) expressed
in the distribution of remains in the excavation (slide 30)?  What
kinds of remains were recovered?</li>
<li>What is an otolith?  How did the identification of <em>`&amp;#0333`io</em> otoliths
change the picture of traditional Hawaiian fishing at Waim&amp;#0257nalo?</li>
<li>Compare the photograph of the stratigraphic profile (slide 13) with
the stratigraphic profile drawn by Kim Kalama (slide 15).  What
kinds of thing are easier to see in the drawing?  Why?</li>
<li>What kinds of activities are represented in the artifact
collection?  How would you characterize traditional Hawaiian
settlement at the site?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dq9">Discussion Questions 9</h2>

<ul>
<li>Describe the distribution of Pu`uwa`awa`a volcanic glass away from
its source in North Kona.  How does this distribution indicate the
value of the glass?</li>
<li>Describe the differences between &ldquo;cost surface overland&rdquo;, &ldquo;`as the
crow flies&rsquo; overland&rdquo;, and &ldquo;canoe from depot&rdquo; models of volcanic
glass distribution.  Is it useful to have these different models?
Why or why not?</li>
<li>At the time of European contact, Hawaiian <em>ali`i</em> were among the
most powerful people in all of Polynesia. Many archaeologists
believe that warfare was essential for <em>ali`i</em> to establish power.
Where does the evidence to support the importance of warfare in old
Hawai`i come from?  Does the archaeological record show that
Hawaiian society was war-like?  Why or why not?</li>
<li>What is the &ldquo;correlate method&rdquo; for identifying states with
archaeological materials?  Accepting that contact-era Hawaiian
society was a state, does the &ldquo;correlate method&rdquo; work?  Why or why
not?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dq10">Discussion Questions 10</h2>

<ul>
<li>Describe the parts of a traditional Hawaiian adze blade.  Which
features do Hawaiian archaeologists use to classify the adze
blades? Do these features relate to the form of the tool, its
function, or both?  How so?</li>
<li>Describe the two reduction sequences identified for Hawaiian
adzes.  How do these sequences relate to the form of the finished
tool?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dq11">Discussion Questions 11</h2>

<ul>
<li>Describe the post-contact history of the Hawaiian adze.  What
social and economic factors contributed to the persistence of stone
adze use in the post-contact period?</li>
<li>Describe the changes in Hawaiian household settlement pattern when
traditional building materials were abandoned and imported
materials took their place.  How were these settlement pattern changes
related to social changes?</li>
<li>What are the cross-cultural attributes of wealth-assets?  How are
wealth-assets distinguished from other valuables?</li>
<li>Describe the development of the leeward Kohala field system.  Would
a map of the field system that charts development by successive
generations of Hawaiian farmers be useful?  Why or why not?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dq12">Discussion Questions 12</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no doubt that canoes were valuable in old Hawai`i.  Were
they also wealth-assets?  Why or why not?</li>
<li>Describe the scale of abrader quarrying at Kahuku.  Does it
surprise you?  Why or why not?  What does the scale of abrader
quarrying indicate about old Hawai`i?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dq13">Discussion Questions 13</h2>

<ul>
<li>Describe the next generation of Hawaiian archaeologists and compare
it to the current generation.  What are the similarities and
differences?  What changes to archaeological practice should the
new generation of archaeologists strive to establish?</li>
<li>Does archaeology have a future in Hawai`i?  Is archaeology useful
in the process of decolonization, or does it work to maintain a
colonized mindset?</li>
</ul>
