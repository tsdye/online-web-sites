Your research presentation should _not_ be a simple "replay" of your
topic but should be re-designed so that you

-   spend some time talking spontaneously
-   employ more than one medium (such as slides)
-   engage your classmates in discussion

A successful presentation will focus on one part of the research, without trying
to cover all of the research in your paper. You will have about 15--20 minutes
to make your presentation; this will include time devoted to questions and
answers.

Your presentation will be graded separately from your paper.
