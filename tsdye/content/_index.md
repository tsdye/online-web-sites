I am an archaeologist based in Honolulu.

From 2001 to 2018, I owned and operated an archaeological consultancy, T. S.
Dye & Colleagues, Archaeologists, where I had the pleasure and privilege of
working with very many fine colleagues.  With me to the end were my partner,
Eric Komori, and two amazing _wahine_, Muffet Jourdane and Kim Kalama.

I've been teaching Hawaiian Archaeology at the University of Hawai\`i at M&#0257;noa
since 2014.

Starting September 2018, I'm working on a research project with Caitlin Buck and
Keith May funded by Historic England. Caitlin is overseeing a PhD student,
Bryony Moody, who will write a thesis about automating the process of generating
chronological models from digital legacy data.

I'm also working with Anne Philippe at Université de Nantes, Laboratoire de
mathématiques Jean Leray on an [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) software package, [`ArchaeoPhases`](http://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/~philippe/ArchaeoPhases.html),
which reads the raw MCMC output of Bayesian calibration software such as [`BCal`](https://bcal.shef.ac.uk/),
[`OxCal`](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html), and [`ChronoModel`](https://chronomodel.com/) and provides a set of functions to
analyze it.

I've developed and released what might be the first open-source Harris Matrix
drawing program, [`hm`](http://tsdye.online/harris-matrix/homepage). I'm using the [`hm`](http://tsdye.online/harris-matrix/homepage) software to investigate the structure and
history of the leeward Kohala field system on Hawai\`i Island.
