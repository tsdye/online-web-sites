			<h1>Classifiers </h1>

			

<p>This section provides definitions for the various classifiers used by the <code>hm</code>
software and shows how to save a classification to a comma-separated-value text
file. There are two kinds of classifiers: archaeological classifiers that
reflect observations and inferences made by an archaeologist familiar with the
stratigraphic situation represented by the sequence diagram; and graph
theoretical classifiers that take advantage of the DAG representation to deduce
structural relations that might prove useful to the archaeologist tasked with
interpreting the sequence diagram.</p>

<p>The <code>hm</code> software currently implements the following classifiers:</p>

<p><a id="orge217e40"></a></p>

<pre><code class="language-lisp">(show-classifiers)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-text">units
levels
phases
periods
adjacent
distance
reachable
</code></pre>

<h2 id="archaeological-classifiers">Archaeological Classifiers</h2>

<p>The <code>hm</code> software currently provides three ways to integrate archaeological
observations about contexts into the sequence diagram, which it calls <code>units</code>,
<code>phases</code>, and <code>periods</code>.  Some preliminary discussion is in order because
archaeologists define these terms more or less precisely and have achieved more
or less consensus on their definitions.  Also, there are very many other terms
in use that attempt to capture the practice of classifying and grouping
archaeological contexts.</p>

<p>Steve Roskams discusses this situation on pages 257–258 of <em>Excavation</em> in the
context of assigning &ldquo;basic units to higher-order categories.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This raises the question of how such groups are to be defined—what is the point
where one stops and another begins?  Should there be a single type of group or a
whole hierarchy of entities?  How should each be named?  Or are the potential
configurations so diverse that it is impossible to make useful comparisons
between sites?</p>

<p>This issue has been approached by a variety of specialists who have produced
different schemes and terminology.  To some extent the differences are a
function of the great variety of sites with which they are dealing, and are thus
entirely legitimate.  Equally, they come, in part, from merely giving a
different name to the same concept &hellip; This profusion of terminology is to be
expected, given that thoughts on such matters are at a very formative stage, and
it is probably right to retain some diversity in any case, given the variety of
sites and associated stratigraphic sequences, and types of analytical procedures
applied to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>units</code> classification offered by the <code>hm</code> software is more precisely
defined and widely appreciated by archaeologists than either <code>periods</code> or
<code>phases</code>. The <code>hm</code> software recognizes the basic distinction of depositional
from interfacial units of stratification and hard-wires this distinction into
the software, while leaving to the <code>hm</code> user the choice of how it might be
represented in the sequence diagram.</p>

<p>The <code>hm</code> software takes no such confident stand with <code>periods</code> and <code>phases</code>,
leaving their definitions (if not their names within the software) completely up
to the user. From the software&rsquo;s point of the view, there is no difference
between a <code>period</code> and a <code>phase</code> and there is no relationship between them. The
<code>hm</code> user is best served by viewing them as ways to incorporate any kind of
classification of contexts whatsoever. The classifications might be based on
statistical analysis of the finds collected from each context, presence or
absence of one or more index fossils, physical characteristics of the contexts
themselves, etc.</p>

<p>In a sense, the crucial question from the software&rsquo;s point of view is how many
different kinds of classification might be useful on a single sequence diagram?
Are two kinds sufficient? The answer to this question does not involve judgments
about how many or few analyses are best carried out on excavation materials.
Rather, it involves how many classifications it might be useful to plot on the
same graphic. If there are a dozen classifications that need to be investigated,
then the way forward is to use the <code>hm</code> software to make 6–12 sequence diagrams,
each one showing one or two classifications, as appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="units">Units</h3>

<p>The <code>units</code> classifier is designed for use with excavation data, where both
depositional and interfacial units are identified and recorded.  Archaeologists
universally identify and record depositional units (often as `layers&rsquo;) but are
somewhat ambivalent about interfaces, typically choosing to record interfaces
that appear to be important and ignoring others.</p>

<p>This practice is potentially problematic for the <code>hm</code> software because it
assumes that interfaces that are not identified and recorded do not themselves
represent chunks of time that might be important in a chronological model. In an
ideal sense, the stratigraphic sequence represents a continuous record of time
from some point in the past represented by the base of excavation up through to
the modern surface. Neglecting to identify and record interfaces potentially
yields a discontinuous model of that continuous record, with gaps introduced by
the time spans represented by the excluded interfaces.</p>

<p>The default configuration file uses node shape to distinguish deposits from
interfaces.  Deposits are shaped like a rectangular box and interfaces are
shaped like a trapezium, as in this snippet from a configuration file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">[Graphviz sequence unit node shape]
deposit = box
interface = trapezium
</code></pre>

<p>Individual deposits and interfaces are identified in the input file for contexts
(see Section ).</p>

<h3 id="periods-and-phases">Periods and Phases</h3>

<p>The stratigraphic DAG for this example shows the Figure 12 section divided into
four periods (fig. <a href="#org8de9ba8">1</a>).  The oldest period includes the Natural ground and its surface.
The next oldest period includes Context 9 and its surfaces.  Next is the
once-whole deposit represented by Contexts 7 and 8, the surfaces of those
contexts, and all of the various contexts related to construction of the wall
stub, Context 5.  The youngest period is represented by the Context 1 deposit
and its surface.</p>

</code></pre>

<h2 id="graph-theoretical-classifiers">Graph Theoretical Classifiers</h2>

<p>The graph theoretical classifiers are defined in the context of a general
definition of a directed graph. The definition used here is paraphrased from the
book, <em>Structural Models in Anthropology</em> written by Per Hage and Frank Harary.
This book is the first in a remarkable trilogy that also includes <em>Exchange in
Oceania: A Graph Theoretic Analysis</em> and <em>Island Networks: Communication,
Kinship, and Classification Structures in Oceania</em>.</p>

<p>One of the challenges presented by the literature on graph theory is the number
of synonyms for the basic elements of a graph (table <a href="#orgb7f96af">1</a>), what this
document and the <code>hm</code> software try to label consistently as nodes and arcs. Hage
and Harary typically use point and arc for directed graphs, and point and line
for graphs. The definitions given below and in the following sections are quoted
verbatim, so it is up to the reader to translate synonyms appropriately.</p>

<p><a id="orgb7f96af"></a></p>

<div class="table-caption">
  <span class="table-number">Table 1:</span>
  Some synonyms for node and arc.

<tr>

<td>branch</td>

<tr>

<td>1-simplex</td>

<tr>

</tbody>

<p>Hage and Harary define a directed graph on page 68 of <em>Structural Models in
Anthropology</em> as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A <em>directed graph</em> or <em>digraph D</em> consists of a finite set <em>V</em> of points and a
collection of ordered pairs of distinct points.  Any such pair <em>(u, v)</em> is
called an <em>arc</em> or <em>directed line</em> and will usually be denoted <em>uv</em>.  The arc
<em>uv</em> goes from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em> and is incident with <em>u</em> and <em>v</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="adjacent">Adjacent</h3>

<p>The adjacency classification is the simplest among the graph theoretical
classifications.  Following on the definition of directed graph, quoted above,
Hage and Harary define adjacency as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The arc <em>uv</em> goes from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em> and is incident with <em>u</em> and <em>v</em>. We also say
that <em>u</em> is <em>adjacent to v</em> and <em>v</em> is adjacent from <em>u</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to note that the sequence diagram represents chronological
adjacency, rather than physical adjacency.  Two contexts that are in contact
with one another can be said to be physically adjacent, but they might be
chronologically separated by one or more other contexts.</p>

<p>This can be seen in the following example, which is based on the stratigraphic
section shown on Figure .</p>

<p>The sequence diagram can be drawn to highlight the relationship of Context 2 to
the others. When the sequence diagram is classified so nodes, node labels, and
edges are colored according to adjacency from Context 2, such that the origin
node is violet, adjacent nodes are cyan, and nodes not adjacent to Context 2 are
orange, the graph in Figure <a href="#org3b0eba0">2</a> results.</p>

<p><a id="org3b0eba0"></a></p>

<p>The graph was produced on a Linux system with the following function call:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Note that Context 2 is in physical contact with Contexts 3 and 5.  The sequence
diagram (fig. <a href="#org3b0eba0">2</a>) shows Context 2 adjacent to Context 3, but
because the Context 2 pit cut into Context 3, which itself was cut into Context
5, Context 2 is not chronologically adjacent to Context 5.</p>

<h3 id="reachable">Reachable</h3>

<p>The graph theoretic definition of reachability requires definitions for directed
walk and path. Hage and Harary define reachability this way on pages 68&ndash;69 of
<em>Structural Models in Anthropology</em>, where they use digraph as a synonym for
directed graph.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A (directed) walk in a digraph is an alternating sequence of points and arcs,
v₀, x₁, v₁, &hellip;, xₙ, vₙ in which each arc xᵢ is vᵢ₋₁vᵢ.  For brevity, we may write
the sequence of points v₀, v₁, &hellip;, vₙ to indicate the same walk.  The length of
such a walk is n, the number of occurrences of arcs in it.  A closed walk has
the same first and last points, and open walk does not, and a spanning walk
contains all the points.  A path is a walk in which all points are distinct; a
cycle is a nontrivial closed walk with all points distinct except the first and
last.  If there is a path from u to v, then v is said to be reachable from u &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compare this definition with Roskams&rsquo; description of reachability as it is
conceptualized by users of the Harris matrix on page 158 of the book,
<em>Excavation</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if one travels from a particular unit via the strands running up from it, all
units through which one passes are provably later than that unit;
if one travels down, every unit <em>en route</em> is provably earlier;
any unit which cannot be reached in one of these two ways has no proven
relationship with the unit in question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This describes all the nodes from which the &ldquo;particular unit&rdquo; is reachable—&rdquo;the
strands running up from it&rdquo;—and all the nodes reachable from &ldquo;the particular
unit&rdquo; that are encountered when one &ldquo;travels down&rdquo;.</p>

<p>One key to dating Çatalhöyük has been identifying residual materials in the
deposits.  A good example of this is Context 1332+, where several seeds were
recovered and dated.  Initially, the seeds were thought to be associated with
the Context 1332+ deposit, but four of them were subsequently determined to be
residual.  The effect of these different residuality determinations on the
dating project at Çatalhöuyük is discussed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440315002459">Dye and Buck</a>.</p>

<p>The importance of Context 1332+ in the stratigraphy of Çatalhöyük is indicated
by a graph classified by reachability (fig. <a href="#org087abf2">3</a>).
This graph assigns dark blue fills to nodes from which Context 1332+ is
reachable and nodes reachable from Context 1332+. The node for Context 1332+ is
filled light blue. Nodes from which Context 1332+ is not reachable and nodes not
reachable from Context 1332+ are filled green.  The colors are taken from the
Brewer color <code>paired</code> palette.</p>

<p>A stratigraphic DAG for the information displayed on Figure <a href="#org087abf2">3</a>
might be drawn on a Linux system with the <code>hm</code> software as follows:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Classification by reachability is potentially important for decisions on what
materials to date.  Contexts that are reachable from many contexts or from which
many contexts are reachable might be thought of as having relatively great
potential influence in a chronological model.</p>

<h3 id="distance">Distance</h3>

<p>The graph theoretic definition of distance follows directly on the definition of
reachability.  Hage and Harary define distance this way on page 69 of
<em>Structural Models in Anthropology</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there is a path from u to v, then v is said to be reachable from u, and the
distance d (u,v) from u to v is the length of any shortest such path.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example of a graph classified by distance is Figure <a href="#orgd99a3b4">4</a>. This graph
assigns node fills based on distance from Context 1332+. The node for Context
1332+ is the lightest blue. Nodes not reachable from Context 1332+ are the
darkest blue. All other nodes have intermediate shades of blue based on their
distance from Context 1332+, the farther the node the darker the color.</p>

<h3 id="levels">Levels</h3>

<p>The graph theoretic concept of level is closely tied to the stratigraphic
concept of level.  Hage and Harary define level on page 82 of <em>Structural Models in Anthropology.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>An acyclic digraph D has no cycles &hellip; [and] is said to have a level assignment,
which assigns a positive integer n for each point v, called its level, if for
each arc vᵢ vⱼ of D, the corresponding integers satisfy nᵢ &lt; nⱼ.  Thus each arc
of D is directed from a lower to a higher level.  If a digraph D has a cycle,
then it cannot have a level assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example of a levels classification can be seen in the stratigraphic DAG of Çatalhöyük (fig. <a href="#org1c00cca">5</a>).</p>

<h2 id="write-a-classification-to-a-file">Write a Classification to a File</h2>

<p>In addition to creating graphical output, the <code>hm</code> software can write a
classification to a comma-separated-value file to communicate with other
software.  The name of the output file is specified in the configuration file;
this protocol insures that the user of an <code>hm</code> project created by someone else
can be certain of a CSV file&rsquo;s contents.</p>

<p>In the example below, the file names for <code>distance</code>, <code>reachable</code>, and <code>adjacent</code>
classifications are helpfully descriptive, while the name given the <code>phases</code>
classification is not too helpful.</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">[Output files]
sequence-dot = fig-12-polygon-1.dot
chronology-dot =
distance = fig-12-distance.csv
reachable = fig-12-reachable.csv
adjacent = fig-12-adjacent.csv
phases = foobar.csv
periods = fig-12-periods.csv
...
</code></pre>

<p>The following transcript writes the <code>periods</code> classifier for the
<code>:fig-12-polygon</code> example to the <code>fig-12-periods.csv</code> file.</p>
