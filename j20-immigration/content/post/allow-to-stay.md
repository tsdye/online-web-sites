## Question {#question}

Many immigrants have followed the law and are in our country legally.
Why should aliens who entered our country illegally be allowed to live here?


## Answer {#answer}

Most of the undocumented immigrants who live in Hawaii have done nothing
illegal arising from their immigration status. Immigrants are undocumented for
one of two reasons: (1) They have entered our country by crossing the border
without being processed, which is a misdemeanor, or (2) They have entered our
country with a visa, but have overstayed, which is a civil offense, and not a
crime. The great majority of undocumented immigrants in Hawaii have overstayed
their visas.
