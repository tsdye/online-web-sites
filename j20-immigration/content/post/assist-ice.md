## Question {#question}

Why shouldn't local law enforcement agencies assist their law enforcement
colleagues at the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE)?


## Answer {#answer}

Immigration enforcement is a federal function. When undocumented
immigrants fear that local police are acting as ICE agents who can initiate
deportation, they are reluctant to make contact with the police. They are
reluctant to report crimes and suspected crimes to the police, and they are
reluctant to come forth as witnesses to crimes. That makes our communities less
safe for everyone.
