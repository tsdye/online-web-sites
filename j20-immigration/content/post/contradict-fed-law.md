## Question: {#question}

Wouldn't a state sanctuary law contradict federal law?


## Background: {#background}

The [Ho\`okipa bill introduced to the Hawai\`i State Legislature in 2018](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure%5Findiv.aspx?billtype=SB&billnumber=2290&year=2018) does not
conflict with federal law because it allows federal immigration efforts to
continue. Constitutional experts agree that the provisions of the Ho\`okipa bill
are legal. None of its provisions have been found by any court to be in
violation of federal law or the U.S. Constitution.

Similar sanctuary laws are common in the U.S.  There are [more than 500 state and
local governments that have adopted some form of sanctuary law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary%5Fcity).


## Answer: {#answer}

No, sanctuary laws are common in the U.S. They do not contradict federal law.
