## Question {#question}

The federal government is following the law in trying to remove
illegal aliens. Why should the State refuse to comply with federal law?


## Answer {#answer}

Hawai\`i is following the law and it will continue to follow the law if it enacts
a sanctuary law. Immigration and the enforcement of immigration law is purely a
federal function. The State and its counties receive no federal funds to support
federal immigration programs. Yet President Trump wants states and their local
governments to help federal immigration agencies, such as the federal
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). For example, Trump wants local
police to act as ICE agents to help identify and deport all undocumented
immigrants.
