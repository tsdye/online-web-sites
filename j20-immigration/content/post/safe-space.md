## Question {#question}

The sanctuary state bill the State Legislature considered in the
2018 session would have provided a safe place for illegal aliens. Why should the
State do that?


## Answer {#answer}

The sanctuary bill considered in 2018 does not provide any additional
protections to undocumented immigrants than it does to citizens. There is no law
requiring the State or its counties to assist federal Immigration and Customs
Enforcement agency (ICE), and the sanctuary state bill merely limits Hawaiiâ€™s
local law enforcement agencies from assisting ICE. Some state and local
governments across the nation do provide assistance to ICE, while more than 600
others refuse to do so because they believe assisting ICE will disrupt their
communities.
