## Question: {#question}

The Ho\`okipa bill introduced to the Hawai\`i State Legislature in 2018 would have
provided a safe place for undocumented immigrants. Why should the State do that?


## Background: {#background}

The [Ho\`okipa bill introduced in 2018](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure%5Findiv.aspx?billtype=SB&billnumber=2290&year=2018) does not provide any additional
protections to undocumented immigrants than it does to citizens.

Here is its description:

> Prohibits state law enforcement agencies from complying with federal immigration
> detainers or honoring requests for non-public information unless specifically
> required to do so by a warrant signed by a judge or federal, state, or local
> law.

There is no law requiring the State or its counties to assist the federal
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), and the Ho\`okipa  bill
merely limits Hawaiiâ€™s local law enforcement agencies from assisting ICE, except
as required by law.

Some state and local governments across the nation do provide assistance to ICE,
while [more than 500 other state and local governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary%5Fcity) refuse to do so because
they believe assisting ICE will disrupt their communities.


## Answer: {#answer}

The Ho\`okipa bill introduced to the Hawai\`i State Legislature in 2018 does not
provide a safe place for undocumented immigrants. It simply directs local law
enforcement agents to assist the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement
agency (ICE) only as required by law.
