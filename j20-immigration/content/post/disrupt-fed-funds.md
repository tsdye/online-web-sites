## Question {#question}

If Hawaii refuses to cooperate with Trump and his immigration
policies, he will retaliate by withholding federal grants to Hawaii. Why should
Hawai\`i unnecessarily put hundreds of millions of federal dollars at risk?


## Answer {#answer}

Actually, very little federal funding would be at risk, because federal
law allows grant moneys to be withheld only when a state does not comply with
the requirements of that particular grant. There is only one grant related to
immigration enforcement, and Hawaii receives a relatively small amount from it.
It should be noted that, despite Hawaii’s high-profile challenge to Trump’s
Muslim travel ban, the federal budget proposed by Trump would actually increase
total federal funding for Hawaii.
