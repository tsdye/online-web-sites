## Question {#question}

Undocumented immigrants are deportable. Hasn't the US always deported
undocumented immigrants?


## Answer {#answer}

In the past, the Obama administration was responsible for deporting
millions of undocumented immigrants who had committed serious crimes. However,
those who had committed no serious crime were allowed to remain in the U.S.
Today, Trump seeks to deport all undocumented immigrants without exception,
whether they have committed a serious crime or not. The federal
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) has recently used
increasingly harsh tactics to identify and deport undocumented immigrants,
including separating children from their parents. Local police should not get
involved with that kind of questionable activity because there is more than
enough serious crime in our communities for police to handle.
