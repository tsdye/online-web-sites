** DONE Why should undocumented immigrants be allowed to stay?

*** Question:
Many immigrants have followed the law and are in our country legally. Why should
undocumented immigrants who entered our country illegally be allowed to live
here?


*** Background:
Immigrants to the U.S. are undocumented for one of two reasons:
 - They have entered our country by crossing the border without being processed,
   which is a misdemeanor, or
 - They have entered our country with a visa, but have overstayed, which is a
   petty offense, and not a crime.

Neither of these reasons involves a felony, which is the most serious kind of
crime.

*** Answer:
The great majority of undocumented immigrants in Hawaii have overstayed their
visas and have done nothing illegal arising from their immigration status. Most
of them are living peaceably among us and are contributing to our economy and
local communities. Many of them have U.S. families, including native born
children, to whom they provide support. Deporting them breaks up families and
communities. It is better for all of us to give undocumented immigrants a path
to citizenship so they can continue to live peaceably among us.

*** Question:
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has characterized the Chicago sanctuary law as
"an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own
residents." Along the same lines, President Trump claimed that "sanctuary cities release
thousands of criminal aliens out of our prisons and jails and back into our
communities. They go into those sanctuary cities when they see them. They go
there because they feel they're safe, and in many cases, they are very bad
actors. We have gang members; we have predators, rapists, killers, a lot of bad
people."  Don't undocumented aliens pose a criminal threat?


*** Background:

The link between [[https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/03/30/the-myth-of-the-criminal-immigrant][immigration and crime]] is a myth that exists in the imaginations
of Americans and nowhere else. With respect to crime in general, undocumented
immigrants have a crime rate that is 44% below that of native-born U.S.
citizens.

*** Answer:

Some undocumented immigrants do pose a criminal threat, but most do not. The
average undocumented immigrant poses less of a criminal threat than the average
U.S. citizen.

*** Question:
Why shouldn’t undocumented immigrants be deported?

*** Background:

Undocumented immigrants [[https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/issues/undocumented-immigrants/][work]], [[https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/how-do-undocumented-immigrants-pay-federal-taxes-an-explainer/][pay taxes]], and [[https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/financial-aid/undocumented-students][send their children to school]].
Some, such as the Kona coffee farmer, [[http://www.staradvertiser.com/2017/07/08/breaking-news/kona-coffee-farmer-says-goodbye-to-family-ahead-of-deportation/][Andres Magana Ortiz]], are leaders in our
communities. Many are married to U.S. citizens, and many of their [[http://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/us-immigration/can-child-undocumented-immigrant-become-citizen.html][children are
U.S. citizens by birth]].

*** Answer:
The estimated 45,000 undocumented immigrants living in Hawaii are so well
integrated into our communities that even their friends and neighbors may not
know they are undocumented. Deporting undocumented immigrants would break up
families and remove the main source of financial support for many minor
children.

*** Question:
The federal government is following the law in trying to remove illegal aliens.
Why should the State refuse to comply with federal law?


*** Background:

Immigration and the enforcement of immigration law is a federal function, not a
state function.  State and county law enforcement agents, such as the sheriff or
the local police, are not legally required to enforce immigration law.

The State of Hawai`i and its counties receive no federal funds to support federal
immigration programs.

Yet President Trump wants states and their local governments to help federal
immigration agencies, such as the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement
agency (ICE). For example, Trump wants local police to act as ICE agents to help
identify and deport all undocumented immigrants.

*** Answer:
Hawai`i *is* following the law. Importantly, Hawai`i will continue to follow the
law if it enacts a sanctuary law, such as the Ho`okipa bill introduced during
the 2018 legislative session.

*** Question:
Undocumented immigrants are deportable. Hasn't the US always deported
undocumented immigrants?

*** Background:
The U.S. is a nation of immigrants.

For more than a century after the nation was founded in 1776, immigration was
not regulated.  Immigrants did not need documentation.

The [[https://www.fairus.org/legislation/reports-and-analysis/history-of-us-immigration-laws][federal government first began to regulate immigration in 1875]], when it
prohibited entry to prostitutes and criminals. At this time, the U.S. welcomed
most immigrants. The Statue of Liberty, a monument to the nation's welcoming
attitude toward immigrants started construction in 1875.

In 1882, the Chinese exclusion law prohibited immigration of Chinese and first
empowered the federal government to deport immigrants. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geary_Act][Geary Act of 1892]]
required Chinese to apply for certificates of residence; Chinese without
certificates were the first immigrants to be deported because they were
undocumented. Undocumented immigrants from other nations were not deported. The
Chinese exclusion act was repealed in 1943.

The first limit on the number of immigrants was imposed in 1921.

More recently, the Obama administration was responsible for deporting
millions of undocumented immigrants who had committed serious crimes. However,
those who had committed no serious crime were allowed to remain in the U.S.

Today, the Trump administration seeks to deport all undocumented immigrants
without exception, whether they have committed a serious crime or not. The
federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) has recently used
increasingly harsh tactics to identify and deport undocumented immigrants,
including separating children from their parents.

*** Answer:

For much of its history, the U.S. welcomed undocumented immigrants and gave them
a path to citizenship. The first undocumented immigrants to be deported in 1892
were Chinese, a racist practice that ended in 1943. Since that time deportation
of undocumented immigrants has been selective. The Trump administration's plan
to deport all undocumented immigrants is novel.

*** Question:
The Ho`okipa bill introduced to the Hawai`i State Legislature in 2018 would have
provided a safe place for undocumented immigrants. Why should the State do that?

*** Background:
The [[https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&billnumber=2290&year=2018][Ho`okipa bill introduced in 2018]] does not provide any additional
protections to undocumented immigrants than it does to citizens.

Here is its description:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Prohibits state law enforcement agencies from complying with federal immigration
detainers or honoring requests for non-public information unless specifically
required to do so by a warrant signed by a judge or federal, state, or local
law.
#+END_QUOTE

There is no law requiring the State or its counties to assist the federal
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), and the Ho`okipa  bill
merely limits Hawaii’s local law enforcement agencies from assisting ICE, except
as required by law.

Some state and local governments across the nation do provide assistance to ICE,
while [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city][more than 500 other state and local governments]] refuse to do so because
they believe assisting ICE will disrupt their communities.

*** Answer:
The Ho`okipa bill introduced to the Hawai`i State Legislature in 2018 does not
provide a safe place for undocumented immigrants. It simply directs local law
enforcement agents to assist the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement
agency (ICE) only as required by law.

*** Question:
Why shouldn't local law enforcement agencies assist their law enforcement
colleagues at the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE)?

*** Background:
Immigration enforcement is a federal function. Local law enforcement agencies
are concerned with policing our communities.  Immigration enforcement is not a
function carried out by local law enforcement agencies.

When undocumented immigrants fear that local police are acting as ICE agents who
can initiate deportation, they are reluctant to make contact with the police.
They are reluctant to report crimes and suspected crimes to the police, and they
are reluctant to come forth as witnesses to crimes.

More than [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city][500 state and local governments]] across the U.S. recognize this
problem.

When members of the community are reluctant to contact the police, the police
have a more difficult time fighting crime. That makes our communities less safe
for everyone.

*** Answer:
Local law enforcement agencies *should* assist ICE as required by law. They
*should not* provide additional assistance to ICE, beyond what is required by
law, because this will interfere with their ability to police local communities.

*** Question:
Wouldn't a state sanctuary law contradict federal law?

*** Background:
The [[https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&billnumber=2290&year=2018][Ho`okipa bill introduced to the Hawai`i State Legislature in 2018]] does not
conflict with federal law because it allows federal immigration efforts to
continue. Constitutional experts agree that the provisions of the Ho`okipa bill
are legal. None of its provisions have been found by any court to be in
violation of federal law or the U.S. Constitution.

Similar sanctuary laws are common in the U.S.  There are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city][more than 500 state and
local governments that have adopted some form of sanctuary law]].

*** Answer:
No, sanctuary laws are common in the U.S. They do not contradict federal law.

*** Question:
Undocumented immigrants are a drain on our communities because they get welfare
and free health care, so why shouldn’t they be deported?

*** Background:
Undocumented immigrants support government financially because they pay
taxes. Yet they do not qualify for the most costly government assistance
programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, although they may
qualify for some smaller government assistance programs. Studies show that
undocumented immigrants pay about as much in taxes as they receive in government
programs.


*** Answer:
Undocumented immigrants are not a drain on our communities.

*** Question:
If Hawaii refuses to cooperate with Trump and his immigration
policies, he will retaliate by withholding federal grants to Hawaii. Why should
Hawai`i unnecessarily put hundreds of millions of federal dollars at risk?

*** Background:
Actually, very little federal funding would be at risk, because federal law
allows grant moneys to be withheld only when a state does not comply with the
requirements of that particular grant.  The [[https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44797.html#_Toc478130447][federal government must take care
not to coerce states]] by withholding funds.

There is only one federal grant related to law enforcement, the [[https://www.bja.gov/jag/][Edward Byrne
Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program]]. Hawaii receives a relatively
small amount from the Byrne JAG program. [[https://www.bja.gov/Programs/JAG/jag17/17HI.pdf][Hawaii's allocation for FY 2017 was
$840,284.00]]. Of this total, the Department of Attorney General will receive
$504,170.40 and $336,113.60 will be directly awarded to the counties. The state
portion of the Byrne JAG grant represents 0.6% of the Department of Attorney
General's operating budget.

The Federal Department of Justice (DOJ) under Attorney General Sessions has
attempted to attach [[https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-sessions-announces-immigration-compliance-requirements-edward-byrne-memorial][conditions to the Byrne JAG grant]]. These conditions seek to
expand state and local government requirements to cooperate with the federal
government in its efforts to enforce federal immigration laws. In September,
2017 a [[https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16080][federal judge in Chicago granted a nationwide injunction]] against these
conditions, holding that it was likely AG Sessions had exceeded his authority by
imposing them.

It should be noted that, despite Hawaii’s high-profile challenge to Trump’s
Muslim travel ban, the federal budget proposed by Trump would actually increase
total federal funding for Hawaii.


*** Answer:
The federal government is barred by law from coercing states in this way. The
Trump administration might threaten to withhold funds, but such a threat would
be a bully's bluster. In any event, the amount of federal funding in question is
not great. It represents less than 1% of the State Attorney General's annual
budget.

*** Question:
Why should we waste time worrying about undocumented immigrants?

*** Answer:
Hawai`i has a rich immigrant heritage that continues and should be allowed
continue, despite any risk of losing a small amount of federal grant money. Most
of us who live in Hawaii are either immigrants or the descendants of immigrants
who sought better lives for themselves and their children. Immigrants have
contributed significantly to our society and the unique character of Hawaii’s
culture. Today’s immigrants, whether documented or not, are no different.

*** Answer:

Support for the 2018 Ho`okipa Bill was strong in the Senate, where it was
introduced by Senators Rhoads, Chang, and Taniguchi. Twenty-two senators
consistently voted for the bill. Senator Mercado Kim had reservations, and
Senators Gabbard and Riviere voted against the bill.

*** Question:

Did my representative support the Ho`okipa Bill during the 2018 legislative session?

*** Background:

In the following table, the marks in the =Ho`ikipa= column have these meanings:
=++= introduced the bill and voted aye; =+= voted aye; =+/-= voted aye with
reservations; =-= voted nay. Note that representative names are linked to
legislative web sites with contact information.

Or, [[file:/qgis2web_2018_07_02-15_43_47_875455/index.html][view a map of House districts]], where bluer indicates stronger support for
the Ho`okipa bill and redder is the opposite.

*** Answer:

In meetings prior to the 2018 session, House leaders made clear to Hawai`i J20
and other supportive groups that the Ho`okipa Bill would not pass the
legislature in 2018. Still, support for the Ho`okipa Bill was strong.

Support for the 2018 Ho`okipa Bill, introduced by Representatives Ing, Brower,
Creagan, Keohokalole, and Lowen, was divided along party lines. Thirty-nine
Democrats supported the bill, while all five Republicans voted against it. Seven
Democrats were "on the fence," either voting with reservations or, in the case
of Representatives Luke and Takayama, refusing to hear the bill in committee.

Technically, the refusals by Representative Luke to hear the House version of
the Ho`okipa Bill in the Finance Committee and by Representative Takayama to
hear the Senate version of the Ho`okipa Bill in the Public Safety Committee
killed the 2018 Ho`okipa Bill.

*** Question:

Why should taxpayers bear the burden of supporting undocumented aliens?

*** Background:
Immigration is a federal function that citizens support with the money they pay
in taxes to the Internal Revenue Service. However, the federal government
routinely deputizes local law enforcement agents to assist in immigration
enforcement, even though the federal government does not provide funding to
local governments for this purpose. This cooperation means local taxpayers
effectively pay twice for immigration enforcement -- once with their federal
taxes, and again with their state and local taxes.

Here in Hawai`i local law enforcement agents routinely cooperate with federal
agencies on immigration issues. One common request, a warrant-less detainer,
asks local law enforcement agents to hold an arrested undocumented immigrant at
OCCC for 48 hours longer than the allowable 24 hours. Federal judges in other
districts have ruled these warrant-less detainers are unlawful. The direct cost
to Hawai`i taxpayers for the cooperation of our local law enforcement agents
over the last 10 years has been estimated at $300,000. In addition, holding
immigrants on warrant-less detainers contributes to the overcrowding of OCCC, a
facility already bursting at the seams.

*** Answer:
A state sanctuary bill will save Hawai`i taxpayers money by refusing to honor
requests for non-public information and warrant-less detainers issued by ICE.
Taxpayers will not have to pay twice for immigration enforcement.
