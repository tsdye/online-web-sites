			Question Attorney General Jeff Sessions has characterized the Chicago sanctuary law as &ldquo;an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents.&rdquo; Along the same lines, President Trump claimed that &ldquo;sanctuary cities release thousands of criminal aliens out of our prisons and jails and back into our communities. They go into those sanctuary cities when they see them. They go there because they feel they&rsquo;re safe, and in many cases, they are very bad actors.

			Question Why shouldn’t undocumented immigrants be deported?
Answer The estimated 45,000 undocumented immigrants living in Hawaii are so well integrated into our communities that even their friends and neighbors may not know they are undocumented. Undocumented immigrants work, pay taxes, and send their children to school. Some are leaders in our communities. Many are married to U.S. citizens, and many of their children are U.S. citizens by birth. Deporting undocumented immigrants would break up families and remove the main source of financial support for many minor children.

			Question Many immigrants have followed the law and are in our country legally. Why should aliens who entered our country illegally be allowed to live here?
Answer Most of the undocumented immigrants who live in Hawaii have done nothing illegal arising from their immigration status. Immigrants are undocumented for one of two reasons: (1) They have entered our country by crossing the border without being processed, which is a misdemeanor, or (2) They have entered our country with a visa, but have overstayed, which is a civil offense, and not a crime.

			Question Illegal aliens are a drain on our communities because they get welfare and free health care, so why shouldn’t they be deported?
Answer Undocumented immigrants support government financially because they pay taxes. Yet they do not qualify for the most costly government assistance programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, although they may qualify for some smaller government assistance programs. Studies show that undocumented immigrants pay about as much in taxes as they receive in government programs.

			Question Doesn&rsquo;t a state sanctuary law contradict federal law?
Answer Hawaii’s proposed sanctuary state bill does not conflict with federal law because it allows federal immigration efforts to continue. Constitutional experts agree that the provisions of Hawaii’s proposed sanctuary state bill are legal. None of its provisions have been found by any court to be in violation of federal law or the U.S. Constitution.

			Question Undocumented immigrants are deportable. Hasn&rsquo;t the US always deported undocumented immigrants?
Answer In the past, the Obama administration was responsible for deporting millions of undocumented immigrants who had committed serious crimes. However, those who had committed no serious crime were allowed to remain in the U.S. Today, Trump seeks to deport all undocumented immigrants without exception, whether they have committed a serious crime or not. The federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) has recently used increasingly harsh tactics to identify and deport undocumented immigrants, including separating children from their parents.

			Question The sanctuary state bill the State Legislature considered in the 2018 session would have provided a safe place for illegal aliens. Why should the State do that?
Answer The sanctuary bill considered in 2018 does not provide any additional protections to undocumented immigrants than it does to citizens. There is no law requiring the State or its counties to assist federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), and the sanctuary state bill merely limits Hawaii’s local law enforcement agencies from assisting ICE.

			Question Why should we waste time worrying about undocumented immigrants?
Answer Hawai`i has a rich immigrant heritage that continues and should be allowed continue, despite any risk of losing a small amount of federal grant money. Most of us who live in Hawaii are either immigrants or the descendants of immigrants who sought better lives for themselves and their children. Immigrants have contributed significantly to our society and the unique character of Hawaii’s culture.

			Question The federal government is following the law in trying to remove illegal aliens. Why should the State refuse to comply with federal law?
Answer Hawai`i is following the law and it will continue to follow the law if it enacts a sanctuary law. Immigration and the enforcement of immigration law is purely a federal function. The State and its counties receive no federal funds to support federal immigration programs.

		<div class="summary">
			Question Why shouldn&rsquo;t local law enforcement agencies assist their law enforcement colleagues at the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE)?
Answer Immigration enforcement is a federal function. When undocumented immigrants fear that local police are acting as ICE agents who can initiate deportation, they are reluctant to make contact with the police. They are reluctant to report crimes and suspected crimes to the police, and they are reluctant to come forth as witnesses to crimes.
