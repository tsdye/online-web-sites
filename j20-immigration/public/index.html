			Question: Why should taxpayers bear the burden of supporting undocumented aliens?
Background: Immigration is a federal function that citizens support with the money they pay in taxes to the Internal Revenue Service. However, the federal government routinely deputizes local law enforcement agents to assist in immigration enforcement, even though the federal government does not provide funding to local governments for this purpose. This cooperation means local taxpayers effectively pay twice for immigration enforcement &ndash; once with their federal taxes, and again with their state and local taxes.

			Question: Why should we waste time worrying about undocumented immigrants?
Answer: Hawai`i has a rich immigrant heritage that continues and should be allowed continue, despite any risk of losing a small amount of federal grant money. Most of us who live in Hawaii are either immigrants or the descendants of immigrants who sought better lives for themselves and their children. Immigrants have contributed significantly to our society and the unique character of Hawaii’s culture.

			Question: If Hawaii refuses to cooperate with Trump and his immigration policies, he will retaliate by withholding federal grants to Hawaii. Why should Hawai`i unnecessarily put hundreds of millions of federal dollars at risk?
Background: Actually, very little federal funding would be at risk, because federal law allows grant moneys to be withheld only when a state does not comply with the requirements of that particular grant. The federal government must take care not to coerce states by withholding funds.

			Question: Undocumented immigrants are a drain on our communities because they get welfare and free health care, so why shouldn’t they be deported?
Background: Undocumented immigrants support government financially because they pay taxes. Yet they do not qualify for the most costly government assistance programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, although they may qualify for some smaller government assistance programs. Studies show that undocumented immigrants pay about as much in taxes as they receive in government programs.

			Question: Wouldn&rsquo;t a state sanctuary law contradict federal law?
Background: The Ho`okipa bill introduced to the Hawai`i State Legislature in 2018 does not conflict with federal law because it allows federal immigration efforts to continue. Constitutional experts agree that the provisions of the Ho`okipa bill are legal. None of its provisions have been found by any court to be in violation of federal law or the U.S. Constitution.
Similar sanctuary laws are common in the U.

			Question: Why shouldn&rsquo;t local law enforcement agencies assist their law enforcement colleagues at the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE)?
Background: Immigration enforcement is a federal function. Local law enforcement agencies are concerned with policing our communities. Immigration enforcement is not a function carried out by local law enforcement agencies.
When undocumented immigrants fear that local police are acting as ICE agents who can initiate deportation, they are reluctant to make contact with the police.

			Question: The Ho`okipa bill introduced to the Hawai`i State Legislature in 2018 would have provided a safe place for undocumented immigrants. Why should the State do that?
Background: The Ho`okipa bill introduced in 2018 does not provide any additional protections to undocumented immigrants than it does to citizens.
Here is its description:
 Prohibits state law enforcement agencies from complying with federal immigration detainers or honoring requests for non-public information unless specifically required to do so by a warrant signed by a judge or federal, state, or local law.
