<h2 id="question">Question:</h2>

<p>If Hawaii refuses to cooperate with Trump and his immigration
policies, he will retaliate by withholding federal grants to Hawaii. Why should
Hawai`i unnecessarily put hundreds of millions of federal dollars at risk?</p>

<h2 id="background">Background:</h2>

<p>Actually, very little federal funding would be at risk, because federal law
allows grant moneys to be withheld only when a state does not comply with the
requirements of that particular grant.  The <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44797.html#%5FToc478130447">federal government must take care
not to coerce states</a> by withholding funds.</p>

<p>There is only one federal grant related to law enforcement, the <a href="https://www.bja.gov/jag/">Edward Byrne
Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program</a>. Hawaii receives a relatively
small amount from the Byrne JAG program. <a href="https://www.bja.gov/Programs/JAG/jag17/17HI.pdf">Hawaii&rsquo;s allocation for FY 2017 was
$840,284.00</a>. Of this total, the Department of Attorney General will receive
$504,170.40 and $336,113.60 will be directly awarded to the counties. The state
portion of the Byrne JAG grant represents 0.6% of the Department of Attorney
General&rsquo;s operating budget.</p>

<p>The Federal Department of Justice (DOJ) under Attorney General Sessions has
attempted to attach <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-sessions-announces-immigration-compliance-requirements-edward-byrne-memorial">conditions to the Byrne JAG grant</a>. These conditions seek to
expand state and local government requirements to cooperate with the federal
government in its efforts to enforce federal immigration laws. In September,
2017 a <a href="https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16080">federal judge in Chicago granted a nationwide injunction</a> against these
conditions, holding that it was likely AG Sessions had exceeded his authority by
imposing them.</p>

<p>It should be noted that, despite Hawaii’s high-profile challenge to Trump’s
Muslim travel ban, the federal budget proposed by Trump would actually increase
total federal funding for Hawaii.</p>

<h2 id="answer">Answer:</h2>

<p>The federal government is barred by law from coercing states in this way. The
Trump administration might threaten to withhold funds, but such a threat would
be a bully&rsquo;s bluster. In any event, the amount of federal funding in question is
not great. It represents less than 1% of the State Attorney General&rsquo;s annual
budget.</p>
