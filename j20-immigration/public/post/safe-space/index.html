<h2 id="question">Question:</h2>

<p>The Ho`okipa bill introduced to the Hawai`i State Legislature in 2018 would have
provided a safe place for undocumented immigrants. Why should the State do that?</p>

<h2 id="background">Background:</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure%5Findiv.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=2290&amp;year=2018">Ho`okipa bill introduced in 2018</a> does not provide any additional
protections to undocumented immigrants than it does to citizens.</p>

<p>Here is its description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prohibits state law enforcement agencies from complying with federal immigration
detainers or honoring requests for non-public information unless specifically
required to do so by a warrant signed by a judge or federal, state, or local
law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no law requiring the State or its counties to assist the federal
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), and the Ho`okipa  bill
merely limits Hawaii’s local law enforcement agencies from assisting ICE, except
as required by law.</p>

<p>Some state and local governments across the nation do provide assistance to ICE,
while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary%5Fcity">more than 500 other state and local governments</a> refuse to do so because
they believe assisting ICE will disrupt their communities.</p>

<h2 id="answer">Answer:</h2>

<p>The Ho`okipa bill introduced to the Hawai`i State Legislature in 2018 does not
provide a safe place for undocumented immigrants. It simply directs local law
enforcement agents to assist the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement
agency (ICE) only as required by law.</p>
