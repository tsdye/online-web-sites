<h2 id="question">Question</h2>

<p>Why shouldn’t undocumented immigrants be deported?</p>

<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

<p>The estimated 45,000 undocumented immigrants living in Hawaii are so well
integrated into our communities that even their friends and neighbors may not
know they are undocumented. Undocumented immigrants work, pay taxes, and send
their children to school. Some are leaders in our communities. Many are married
to U.S. citizens, and many of their children are U.S. citizens by birth.
Deporting undocumented immigrants would break up families and remove the main
source of financial support for many minor children.</p>
