      <description>The subtitle of this 1,019 page book is The First Postmodern Survey of Philosophy from Ancient Times to the Turn of the Twenty-First Century. Written by John Deely, a Thomist scholar who spent 15 years translating the seventeenth century Latin work, Tractatus de Signis by John Poinsot (also known as John of St. Thomas), the Four Ages of Understanding argues that the development of the concept of sign is the central thread in the history of philosophy.</description>

      <description>Philosophy isn&amp;rsquo;t wildly popular among archaeologists today. Back in the 1970s, the New Archaeology threw its hat in the logical positivists&amp;rsquo; ring.
