Philosophy from Ancient Times to the Turn of the Twenty-First Century.</em> Written
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%5FDeely">John Deely</a>, a Thomist scholar who spent 15 years translating the seventeenth
century Latin work, <em>Tractatus de Signis</em> by John Poinsot (also known as John of
St. Thomas), the <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/four-ages-of-understanding-the-first-postmodern-survey-of-philosophy-from-ancient-times-to-the-turn-of-the-twenty-first-century/oclc/277235600/editions?referer=di&amp;editionsView=true"><em>Four Ages of Understanding</em></a> argues that the development of the
concept of <em>sign</em> is the central thread in the history of philosophy.</p>

<p>The four ages of understanding in the title correspond for the most part with
the dominant language(s) of philosophy. So far as is known, philosophy got its
start as an independent line of thought in ancient Greece, where it was
conceived as the study of nature and given the name &ldquo;physics&rdquo;. Greek philosphers
in the first age of understanding didn&rsquo;t dwell on the idea of sign and the Greek
word that John Locke in the seventeenth century applied to the study of signs,
σημειον or semiosis, was confined to natural signs, such as symptoms of disease
or smoke from a fire.  Deely traces Greek philosophy from Thales of Miletus (c.
625–545 BC) to Proclus (c. AD 410–485) and Pseudo-Dionysius (c. AD 455–c. 535).</p>

<p>With the fall of the Roman empire and subsequent loss of Greek philosophy in the
West until the thirteenth century revival of Aristotle&rsquo;s works, the Latin age of
understanding was left to develop its own philosophy of being, which in Deely&rsquo;s
hands stretches from Augustine&rsquo;s (AD 354–430) introduction of the notion of sign
through to John Poinsot&rsquo;s (AD 1589–1644) grounding of the concept in the
<em>Tractatus de Signis</em>. The work of Scholastics from Augustine to Poinsot is
treated in great detail, consistent with Deely&rsquo;s Thomism and his concern and
obvious love for a scholarly tradition that recognizes the accomplishments of
predecessors when advancing claims that expand the intellectual horizon. The
more than 300 pages devoted to the Latin age will likely leave the modern reader
a bit daunted, but with a firm appreciation for the subtlety, intricacy, and
complexity of Scholastic thought.</p>

<p>During the modern age, which began with Descartes (AD 1596–1650) and extended
through to Husserl (AD 1859–1938), Russell (AD 1872–1970), and Wittgenstein (AD
1889–1950), philosophy was developed in national languages and not in Latin.
Deely&rsquo;s contempt for modern philosophy runs deep; in his view, the modern
philosophers who dominate the academy today have &ldquo;become to philosophy&rsquo;s future
what the judges of Galileo were to the future of science.&rdquo; Ouch! In Deely&rsquo;s
view, the moderns, in their justified reaction to the abuses of religious
authority that blocked the way of inquiry, threw out the semiotic baby with the
authoritarian bathwater. Their naive view that ideas represent objects in a
dyadic relationship in the mind ignored the real triadic relation established
between a representamen and an interpretant by a sign.  Modern debates over
whether the world exists outside the mind strike Deely as ghastly reminders of
the damage done to the philosophical tradition when the concept of sign was
lost or ignored in the modern age.</p>

<p>The future of philosophy belongs to post-modernism, which was introduced
programmatically by John Locke (AD 1632–1704), but whose foundations were
developed by the American logician Charles Sanders Peirce (AD 1839–1914).
According to Deely, Peirce&rsquo;s work was a clear advance on the work of the Latins.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Latins, for the most part, got only as far as establishing the being proper
to signs, the common factor or element which justifies the notion of sign in
general in Augustine&rsquo;s sense and removes it from every theoretical context of
nominalism.  But Peirce, in good medieval fashion, goes at once from this as
established terrain to consider what immediately follows from it, namely the
action proper to signs … Recall what Peirce said about the sign in its proper
character as a genuine mediation: anything is related to a second thing, its
Object, in respect to a quality, its Ground, in such a way as to bring a third
thing, its Interpretant, into relation to the same Object, and that in such a
way as to bring a fourth into relation to that Object in the same form, <em>ad
infinitum</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the action proper to signs is combined with Peirce&rsquo;s claim that all thought
is in signs, then the infinite semiosis described above becomes a good
description of the activity that generates an intellectual tradition, such as the
one Deely uncovers so wonderfully in <em>Four Ages of Understanding</em>.</p>
