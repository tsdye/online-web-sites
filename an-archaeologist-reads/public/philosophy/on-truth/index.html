<body><div class="wrap"><div class="section" id="title">On Truth</div><div class="section" id="content"><p>Frank Plumpton Ramsey, who died in 1930 at the age of 26, was &ldquo;an extraordinary
scholarly phenomenon,&rdquo; according to his editors, <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~rescher/">Nicholas Rescher</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/71635.html">Ulrich
Majer</a>. He was appointed Cambridge University Lecturer in Mathematics at the age
of 22. According to <a href="http://philosophy.utoronto.ca/directory/cheryl-misak/">Cheryl Misak</a>, among many accomplishments in the few short
years of his career &ldquo;he managed to figure out how to measure partial belief and
hence lay the groundwork for decision theory and Bayesian statistics.&rdquo; Misak&rsquo;s
book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cambridge-pragmatism-9780198712077?cc=ca&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>Cambridge Pragmatism, from Peirce and James to Ramsey and Wittgenstein</em></a>,
describes how Ramsey took up several pragmatic insights and expanded upon them
in <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/on-truth-original-manuscript-materials-1927-1929-from-the-ramsey-collection-at-the-university-of-pittsburgh/oclc/965553015&amp;referer=brief_results"><em>On Truth</em></a>, a book manuscript that was unfinished when he died.</p>

<p>Chapter 5, <em>Judgment and Time</em>, &ldquo;develops some very general considerations about
events in time.&rdquo; Ramsey argues that Einstein&rsquo;s theory that time is not absolute,
but is instead relative to an observer&rsquo;s position in space-time, has
implications for the definition of &ldquo;event.&rdquo; The common view of event, which
Ramsey calls the &ldquo;substance theory&rdquo;, considers the world to comprise a
collection of enduring substances liable to change, and defines an event as an
important change in the quality or relations of substances. Ramsey argues that
the &ldquo;substance theory&rdquo; posits substances and absolute time among the ultimate
constituents of the world, a position that flatly contradicts Einstein&rsquo;s
theory of relativity.  The problem the substance theory poses for &ldquo;event&rdquo; is
that it confounds two distinct concepts, which can be distinguished if a
relative theory of time is adopted and events defined as &ldquo;regions or volumes of
space-time &hellip; are taken to be the ultimate constituents of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ramsey illustrates the problem with the example of an eclipse, which the
&ldquo;substance theory&rdquo; considers an event.  Ramsey argues that an eclipse is instead
a fact about relations among three events:</p>

<ul>
<li>the space-time occupied by the sun;</li>
<li>the space-time occupied by earth in its orbit around the sun; and</li>
<li>the space-time occupied by the moon in its orbit around the earth.</li>
</ul>

<p>He proposes to call such facts about events &ldquo;occurrences&rdquo; to distinguish them
from the space-time events that are the ultimate constituents of the world.</p>
