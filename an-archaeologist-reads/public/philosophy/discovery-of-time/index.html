<body><div class="wrap"><div class="section" id="title">The Discovery of Time</div><div class="section" id="content"><p>This seminal study of how geology and biology became historical sciences was
written by the philosopher <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jan/10/stephen-toulmin-obituary">Stephen Toulmin</a> and the historian and scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June%5FGoodfield">June
Goodfield</a>. It was published by Harper &amp; Row in 1965 and has been reprinted
regularly since then by the <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo3615904.html">University of Chicago Press</a>.</p>

<dd>Quoting Lucretius&rsquo; poem <em>On the Nature of Things</em>: &ldquo;Our age cannot
look back to earlier things except where reasoning reveals their
traces.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>p. 50</dt>
<dd><em>The Limits of the Classical World Picture</em> lists the
accomplishments for which later generations were indebted to the
Greek philosophers: &ldquo;they had experimented with almost all the forms
of theory which were to dominate later thought, and had recognized
the characteristic merits and defects of each. In Plato&rsquo;s <em>Timaeus</em>,
we have the nearest thing in pre-Christian philosophy to a
`Big-Bang&rsquo; cosmology, in Aristotle the outlines of a `Steady-State&rsquo;
theory: the Stoics, in turn, pioneered a `Cyclical Cosmos&rsquo;, while
the Epicureans saw the development of the world rather as a random,
One-Way Process. Not until many centuries later could scientists put
the history of Nature on a solid basis of established facts and
secure inferences.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>p. 262</dt>
<dd>Speaking about the current state of inquiry into cosmological
origins, Toulmin and Goodfield look to the history of thought in
geology and biology for guidance: &ldquo;In all other historical
sciences, the crucial transition to the phase of cumulative advance
has been marked by a changeover from <em>a priori</em> patterns of theory
to an empirical, developmental method of enquiry.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>p. 263</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;It has always been a struggle for men to renounce the apparent
short-cuts which <em>a priori</em> patterns of theory offer them, and to
build up a genuinely empirical account of historical change and
development laboriously and without preconceptions.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>p. 266</dt>
<dd>The discovery of time in geology and biology each required several key components:

<ul>
<li>recognition of the extent of the past; and</li>
<li>identification of developmental processes, including

<ul>
<li>repetitive <strong>universal factors</strong> operative at all times and places, and</li>
<li>cumulative and progressive <strong>conditional factors</strong> significant at particular stages</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></dd>
</dl>

<p>How does archaeology fit in?</p>

<table>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue that archaeology has not become an historical science because it has
yet to come to grips with the conditional factor. The best analogue for the
geologists&rsquo; use of the fossil record is the division of Old World archaeology
into the Old and New Stone Ages, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, a system that can&rsquo;t
be applied meaningfully to the New World. The heroic effort of evolutionary
archaeologists to work out a cultural version of biological evolution holds
promise, but has yet to bear substantial fruit.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is time to think outside the box?</p>
