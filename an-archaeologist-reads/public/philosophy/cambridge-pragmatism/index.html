<body><div class="wrap"><div class="section" id="title">Cambridge Pragmatism</div><div class="section" id="content"><p>I was drawn to <em>Cambridge Pragmatism: From Peirce and James to Ramsey and
Wittgenstein</em> by <a href="http://philosophy.utoronto.ca/directory/cheryl-misak/">Cheryl Misak</a> because it brings together subjective probability
and C. S. Peirce&rsquo;s pragmatism, two lines of thought I admire but whose
relationship to one another was a mystery to me. Misak is a foremost authority
on Peirce and pragmatism whose many books and articles are written with a
clarity that makes them accessible to someone trained as an archaeologist,
rather than a philosopher.</p>

<p>My admiration of subjective probability goes back more than 25 years, and comes
from habits acquired during the practice of Bayesian calibration of
archaeological radiocarbon dates. Early on, I ran across situations where the
prior information of the Bayesian chronological model improved, often markedly,
both the accuracy and precision of the date estimate. This was an important
discovery for my work in Hawai`i where the uncertainty in radiocarbon dating due
to Industrial Revolution&rsquo;s use of coal power, which pumped &ldquo;dead&rdquo; carbon into
the atmosphere and altered the global radiocarbon balance, makes the last
quarter of the archaeological sequence almost impossible to date precisely
without the addition of the prior information made possible by Bayesian
calibration. Later on, I realized that Bayesian chronological models could be
constructed to keep an analysis from running off the rails, providing what my
colleague Tim Rieth calls &ldquo;bookends&rdquo; that keep the estimate from straying too
early or too late. The ad hoc methods used by many archaeologists in Hawai`i
lack this useful property and, indeed, many of their analyses have run silently
off the rails. My experience has led me to believe subjective probabilities are
good for archaeological thinking. The tie in to Misak&rsquo;s book is that the Ramsey
of its subtitle is Frank Plumpton Ramsey, who laid the mathematical foundations
of subjective probability at Cambridge in the 1920s. I was keen to know what
Ramsey made of pragmatism.</p>

<p>My admiration of Peirce and pragmatism is more recent. I&rsquo;d run across Peirce&rsquo;s
name when <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1hs7w49v">Per Hage</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/25/obituaries/frank-harary-83-a-top-scholar-on-a-mathematical-specialty-dies.html">Frank Harary</a> cited his work on the logic of relations in
<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/structural-models-in-anthropology/oclc/938930741&amp;referer=brief%5Fresults"><em>Structural Models in Anthropology</em></a> and
<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/exchange-in-oceania-a-graph-theoretic-analysis/oclc/22307220&amp;referer=brief%5Fresults"><em>Exchange
in Oceania: A Graph Theoretic Analysis</em></a>. But it wasn&rsquo;t until I read a
conference paper by the French archaeologist Fran√ßois Djindjian that I was
stimulated to read Peirce&rsquo;s two essays, <a href="http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html">&ldquo;How to Make Our Ideas Clear&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.peirce.org/writings/p107.html">&ldquo;The
Fixation of Belief.&rdquo;</a> Peirce&rsquo;s analysis of inquiry as transforming doubt into
belief through a process that involved abduction, deduction, and induction was
an eye-opener for me. When I was in graduate school, New Archaeologists were
arguing that the inductive reasoning used by culture historians was inferior to
the deductive reasoning they championed. Although I wasn&rsquo;t convinced one was
better than the other, I thought the two were somehow antithetical and it hadn&rsquo;t
occurred to me they might be complementary in the way Peirce explained so
clearly.</p>

<p>The mystery about the relationship of subjective probability and pragmatism
started many years ago, when I read somewhere (that I&rsquo;ve now forgotten and am
too busy to track down) that Peirce discounted subjective probability and was a
strong advocate of objective probability. As an undergraduate, I took a course
on probability theory where I learned a bit about the acrimonious debates
between frequentists and subjectivists and I was perplexed to imagine that
Peirce and I appeared to be on opposite sides of the debate. Peirce was a
scientist deeply involved with issues of measurement&mdash;for 32 years he worked
for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey making careful measurements of the
intensity of the earth&rsquo;s gravitational field using pendulums that he designed
and built&mdash;and I felt certain that the experience I&rsquo;d had with Bayesian
calibration was of a kind that Peirce would have recognized and appreciated.</p>

<p>Misak&rsquo;s book solved my mystery. Peirce was not a staunch objectivist, but
recognized both objective and subjective probability. However, he believed that
objective probability is fundamental because it is determined by facts. In his
view, the degrees of belief calculated by the subjectivist must be keyed to
objective probability, so that one&rsquo;s beliefs correspond closely to facts. Ramsey
credits his reading of Peirce with stimulating his interest in probability, an
interest that led him to formulate the mathematical basis of subjective
probability. In a sense then, the Bayesian calibration that I practice in
archaeology counts Peirce and pragmatism among its intellectual ancestors.</p>
