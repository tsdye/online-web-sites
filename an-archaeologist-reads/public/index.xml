      <description>I was drawn to Cambridge Pragmatism: From Peirce and James to Ramsey and Wittgenstein by Cheryl Misak because it brings together subjective probability and C. S. Peirce&amp;rsquo;s pragmatism, two lines of thought I admire but whose relationship to one another was a mystery to me. Misak is a foremost authority on Peirce and pragmatism whose many books and articles are written with a clarity that makes them accessible to someone trained as an archaeologist, rather than a philosopher.</description>

      <description>The subtitle of this 1,019 page book is The First Postmodern Survey of Philosophy from Ancient Times to the Turn of the Twenty-First Century. Written by John Deely, a Thomist scholar who spent 15 years translating the seventeenth century Latin work, Tractatus de Signis by John Poinsot (also known as John of St. Thomas), the Four Ages of Understanding argues that the development of the concept of sign is the central thread in the history of philosophy.</description>

      <description>Frank Plumpton Ramsey, who died in 1930 at the age of 26, was &amp;ldquo;an extraordinary scholarly phenomenon,&amp;rdquo; according to his editors, Nicholas Rescher and Ulrich Majer. He was appointed Cambridge University Lecturer in Mathematics at the age of 22. According to Cheryl Misak, among many accomplishments in the few short years of his career &amp;ldquo;he managed to figure out how to measure partial belief and hence lay the groundwork for decision theory and Bayesian statistics.</description>

      <description>In archaeology, we are accustomed to investing great effort into collecting data from fieldwork, museum collections, and other sources, followed by detailed description, rigorous analysis, and in many cases ending with publication of our findings in short, highly concentrated reports or journal articles. Very often, these publications are all that is visible of this lengthy process, and even then, most of our journal articles are only accessible to scholars at institutions paying subscription fees to the journal publishers.</description>

      <title>Wealth in old Hawai`i</title>
      <link>http://www.tsdye.online/an-archaeologist-reads/archaeology/dye-ao-2014/</link>

      <description>The journals of Captain Cook and his crew contradict bad-year economic theories that posit traditional Hawaiian farmers were living at the margin. Recognising that pig herds were wealth-assets in old Hawaiâ€˜i, an alternative good-year economic theory is developed that interprets the introduction of sweet potato and the development of the rain-fed agricultural systems in which it was cultivated as processes in the creation and management of wealth. The wealth produced in this way was probably used, in part, to promote marriage alliances among elite families.</description>

      <description>This seminal study of how geology and biology became historical sciences was written by the philosopher Stephen Toulmin and the historian and scientist June Goodfield. It was published by Harper &amp;amp; Row in 1965 and has been reprinted regularly since then by the University of Chicago Press.
