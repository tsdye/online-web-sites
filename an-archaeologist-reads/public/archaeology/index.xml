      <description>The journals of Captain Cook and his crew contradict bad-year economic theories that posit traditional Hawaiian farmers were living at the margin. Recognising that pig herds were wealth-assets in old Hawaiâ€˜i, an alternative good-year economic theory is developed that interprets the introduction of sweet potato and the development of the rain-fed agricultural systems in which it was cultivated as processes in the creation and management of wealth. The wealth produced in this way was probably used, in part, to promote marriage alliances among elite families.</description>
