that posit traditional Hawaiian farmers were living at the margin.
Recognising that pig herds were wealth-assets in old Hawai‘i, an alternative
good-year economic theory is developed that interprets the introduction of sweet
potato and the development of the rain-fed agricultural systems in which it was
cultivated as processes in the creation and management of wealth. The wealth
produced in this way was probably used, in part, to promote marriage alliances
among elite families. According to the good-year economic theory, fluctuations
in the products of the rain-fed agricultural facilities introduced variability
into the supply of wealth-assets, which complicated the maintenance of alliances
and were one cause of the wars that played a crucial role in the emergence of
primary states in traditional Hawai‘i.</p>
