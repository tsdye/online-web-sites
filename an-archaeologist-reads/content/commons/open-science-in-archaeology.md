In archaeology, we are accustomed to investing great effort into collecting data
from fieldwork, museum collections, and other sources, followed by detailed
description, rigorous analysis, and in many cases ending with publication of our
findings in short, highly concentrated reports or journal articles. Very often,
these publications are all that is visible of this lengthy process, and even
then, most of our journal articles are only accessible to scholars at
institutions paying subscription fees to the journal publishers. While this
traditional model of the archaeological research process has long been effective
at generating new knowledge about our past, it is increasingly at odds with
current norms of practice in other sciences. Often described as “open science,”
these new norms include data stewardship instead of data ownership, transparency
in the analysis process instead of secrecy, and public involvement instead of
exclusion. While the concept of open science is not new in archaeology a less
transparent model often prevails, unfortunately.
