The commons describes that part of the world to which you and I cannot be denied
use and enjoyment. One doesn't hear much about the commons today, but it isn't
a thing of the past!

The commons is a key component of science, the community practice of inquiry
that requires experiments be repeatable and analyses be reproducible. It is a
bedrock for volunteer organizations that create the [finest software](https://www.fsf.org/) around.
Archaeologists are [discovering it](https://osf.io/2dfhz/)!
