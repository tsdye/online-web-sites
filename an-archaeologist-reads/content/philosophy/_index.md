Philosophy isn't wildly popular among archaeologists today. Back in the 1970s,
the New Archaeology threw its hat in the logical positivists' ring. This turned
out to be a poor choice, for reasons described in detail by [Alison Wylie](http://alisonwylie.net/) and
[Merrilee Salmon](http://inference-review.com/article/successful-science), among others. Most archaeologists have been cool to philosophy
since then.

Why read philosophy now?  Take a look!
