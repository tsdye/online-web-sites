This seminal study of how geology and biology became historical sciences was
written by the philosopher [Stephen Toulmin](https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jan/10/stephen-toulmin-obituary) and the historian and scientist [June
Goodfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Goodfield). It was published by Harper & Row in 1965 and has been reprinted
regularly since then by the [University of Chicago Press](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo3615904.html).

p. 49
: Quoting Lucretius' poem _On the Nature of Things_: "Our age cannot
    look back to earlier things except where reasoning reveals their
    traces."


p. 50
: _The Limits of the Classical World Picture_ lists the
    accomplishments for which later generations were indebted to the
    Greek philosophers: "they had experimented with almost all the forms
    of theory which were to dominate later thought, and had recognized
    the characteristic merits and defects of each. In Plato's _Timaeus_,
    we have the nearest thing in pre-Christian philosophy to a
    \`Big-Bang' cosmology, in Aristotle the outlines of a \`Steady-State'
    theory: the Stoics, in turn, pioneered a \`Cyclical Cosmos', while
    the Epicureans saw the development of the world rather as a random,
    One-Way Process. Not until many centuries later could scientists put
    the history of Nature on a solid basis of established facts and
    secure inferences."


p. 262
: Speaking about the current state of inquiry into cosmological
    origins, Toulmin and Goodfield look to the history of thought in
    geology and biology for guidance: "In all other historical
    sciences, the crucial transition to the phase of cumulative advance
    has been marked by a changeover from _a priori_ patterns of theory
    to an empirical, developmental method of enquiry."


p. 263
: "It has always been a struggle for men to renounce the apparent
    short-cuts which _a priori_ patterns of theory offer them, and to
    build up a genuinely empirical account of historical change and
    development laboriously and without preconceptions."

p. 266
: The discovery of time in geology and biology each required several key components:
    -   recognition of the extent of the past; and
    -   identification of developmental processes, including
        -   repetitive **universal factors** operative at all times and places, and
        -   cumulative and progressive **conditional factors** significant at particular stages

How does archaeology fit in?

| Discipline  | Universal factor    | Conditional factor    |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Geology     | Stratigraphy        | Speciation of fossils |
| Biology     | Genetic inheritance | Selection             |
| Archaeology | Stratigraphy        | Culture change?       |

I'd argue that archaeology has not become an historical science because it has
yet to come to grips with the conditional factor. The best analogue for the
geologists' use of the fossil record is the division of Old World archaeology
into the Old and New Stone Ages, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, a system that can't
be applied meaningfully to the New World. The heroic effort of evolutionary
archaeologists to work out a cultural version of biological evolution holds
promise, but has yet to bear substantial fruit.

Perhaps it is time to think outside the box?
